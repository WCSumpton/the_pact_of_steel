<h1>PACT OF STEEL</h1><br>     Created by: Black Elk, Madmat, Beagle and Cousin Joe</b> <br>     Pact of Steel is an original TripleA module, using the standard ww2v2 revised ruleset.<br>      Our initial goal was to incorporate Italy as the 6th major power in the game, and along the way to correct some      of the imbalances we saw in standard games. The module represents a hypothetical WW2 scenario, which tries      to reproduce what the war might have been like in 1942 had Mussolini been more successful in his early Mediterranean      campaigns.<br><br>     The game functions under a 15 VC set up with Major Victory at 11 VCs captured (the new VCs are Stalingrad,      Sydney and Honolulu.)<br><br>     For fully compliant LHTR rules, please Deactivate 'Always on AA'.  Then Activate      'LHTR Carrier production rules', 'LHTR Heavy Bombers', 'Territory Turn Limit', and set 'Super Sub Defence Bonus' to '1'.<br><br><i>     I think the module is an excellent example of what users can accomplish with tripleA's custom      editing tools. A few months ago Pact of Steel was just an interesting 'what-if' scenario, but thanks to the efforts      of the tripleA community we now have an actual game to play. I hope everyone enjoys it. <br><br>     Thanks again thanks to all the Devs and playtesters who helped get this project together: <br>      DMA02 (Nekro), Iron Cross, Aibrahim, SGB, KC1189, Zero Pilot, Tactics, Underdog and the whole crew.
